/i Telegram sticker design: a pirate skull in a tattered tricorn hat gives two thumbs up, framed by cracked ship wheels and frayed ropes. A single bold inscription "BLP THUMB" is integrated into the artwork on a torn blood-stained banner. White skull with deep shadows, cracked bone, worn teeth; glowing hollow eyes with faint smoke rising. Subtle accents: crimson red (banner stains), muted cyan (rope), steel blue (wheel), metallic gold (tooth, hat trim). Dark, gritty, high-contrast shading, cursed pirate vibe. Black background with thick white outline, classic sticker style. Ominous and iconic.

Dark-fantasy abstract background of a forgotten system. No characters/buildings/trees.
Distributed multi-cluster layout; strictly no single emblem or dominant symbol.
Fill with many small hand-drawn motifs: pen-and-ink sketches, crosshatching + stippling, pencil tests, charcoal smudges, chalk scrawls, silverpoint scratches, dry-brush streaks; occult marginalia and unreadable pseudo-diagrams, blueprint linework fragments, runic doodles; micro-skull filigree (none >5% of frame), misty spirit wisps/orbs; thin broken rings, lissajous/rose curves, spirograph residues, Voronoi crack lines, isometric wireframe hints, faint moir√© grids, particle dust, fBM fog.
Keep a calmer low-contrast mid-center for overlays; edge-weighted detail; layered translucency, subtle volumetric fog, soft bloom.
Painterly gothic-fantasy, gritty textures, filmic contrast.
Palette: soot black, deep teal/indigo, muted cyan, hints of magenta-violet and faint emerald glow.
