/i Telegram sticker design: a pirate skull in a tattered tricorn hat gives two thumbs up, framed by cracked ship wheels and frayed ropes. A single bold inscription "BLP THUMB" is integrated into the artwork on a torn blood-stained banner. White skull with deep shadows, cracked bone, worn teeth; glowing hollow eyes with faint smoke rising. Subtle accents: crimson red (banner stains), muted cyan (rope), steel blue (wheel), metallic gold (tooth, hat trim). Dark, gritty, high-contrast shading, cursed pirate vibe. Black background with thick white outline, classic sticker style. Ominous and iconic.

/i Sticker-style dark fantasy seamless pattern background: pirate and cursed motifs (skulls in shredded tricorn hats, jagged cutlasses, cracked ship wheels, frayed ropes, torn sails, glowing runes, misty orbs, sparks, flames) arranged in radial symmetry. Larger elements near the center, gradually smaller outward, forming a dense repeating mandala-like pattern. No single logo or text, just evenly filled background. Flat bold shapes, sharp edges, thick white outlines, high contrast. Dark base with bone white, crimson red, muted cyan, steel blue, metallic gold, and fiery orange accents. Aggressive, ominous, iconic look. Optimized for OpenGraph repository background.
